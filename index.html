      <p class="para">
        <b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</b> is the most basic building
        block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.
        Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web
        page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior
        (JavaScript). "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to
        one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links
        are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the
        Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become
        an active participant in the World Wide Web.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        <b>CSS </b>is among the core languages of the open web and is
        standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications.
        Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was
        done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest
        recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even
        CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now
        just "CSS" with individual CSS modules having version numbers.
      </p>
      <h1 class="heading">What is a hyperlink?</h1><br>
      <p class="para">
       
        the scope of the specification increased
        significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to
        differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release
        recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS
        specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest
        stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress.
        CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color
        Module Level 5.

        This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've
        gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some
        basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This
        module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we
        have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders,
        debugging, and lots more. The aim here is to provide you with a
        toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the
        essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like
        text styling and CSS layout. CSS styling text With the basics of the
        CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is
        styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here
        we look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font,
        boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other
        text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom
        fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.

      <h1 class="heading">Anatomy of a link</h1>
      <p class="para">
        A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element and using the href
          attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

          HTML

            I'm creating a link to
            <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
           
            This gives us the following result:
            I'm creating a link to the Mozilla homepage.
          </p>
          <h1 class="heading">A quick primer on URLs and paths</h1>
          <p class="para">
            To fully understand link targets, you need to understand URLs and file paths. This section gives you the
            information you need to achieve this.

            A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator is a string of text that defines where something is located on the Web.
            For example, Mozilla's English homepage is located at https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/.

            URLs use paths to find files. Paths specify where the file you're interested in is located in the
            filesystem. Let's look at an example of a directory structure, see the creating-hyperlinks directory.
